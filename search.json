    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nWhen interfacing mechanical inputs with digital systems, two key challenges must be addressed: switch bouncing and metastability. Switch bouncing occurs when a button press causes rapid transitions between logic levels before settling, often leading to multiple false detections. Metastability, on the other hand, arises when asynchronous signals from user inputs do not align with the system clock, potentially causing undefined or unstable logic states. Accounting for both circumstances was essential to ensure reliable key registration and predictable circuit behavior.\nA slow clock divider reduced the 48 MHz system clock to 240 Hz, providing sufficient time between samples to eliminate switch bounce. A two-stage synchronizer stabilized asynchronous signals from the keypad to prevent metastability. The main control logic was implemented as a finite state machine (FSM) that sequentially scanned each keypad row, detected valid presses, and ensured that only one key was registered per activation."

Implement:\n- A clock divider that derives a scan clock on the order of 100–200 Hz.\n- A keypad scanning controller that iterates one active-low column at a time and samples rows, registering at most one key per press (debounce-by-design).\n- A top-level module that updates two hex digits (older and most recent) when a new key is registered and drives a time-multiplexed display without flicker.\nUse idiomatic SystemVerilog (logic, always_ff, enumerated states for FSMs). Keep all state synchronous and well-commented.\n\n\n\nThe LLM performed impressively in generating ax complete, synthesizable SystemVerilog design that met the project requirements for the Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA. It correctly structured the design into modular components using correct SystemVerilog syntax like always_ff, enumerated states, and clear signal naming. The code was synthesizable. Overall, the LLM’s output demonstrated a solid understanding of hardware design principles and FSM-based control logic.\n\n\nLLM Prompt B.1: One-shot Registration (Debounce-by-design)\n\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA\nWrite a synthesizable SystemVerilog module that produces a one-shot registration signal for the keypad system. Behavior:\n- When a key press is first detected, capture the key code and assert a single-cycle “new key” pulse.\n- While any key remains pressed, ignore further inputs.\n- Accept a new key only after all keys are released.\nImplement as a small synchronous FSM with glitch-free outputs and clean interfaces.\n\n\n\n\nLLM Prompt B.2: Keypad Scanner Controller\n\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA\nWrite a synthesizable SystemVerilog module that cycles through keypad columns (active-low, one at a time) and samples rows (active-low) to detect a single key at a time.\n- Iterate columns at a suitable scan rate.\n- Detect and report stable key codes for standard 4×4 layout.\n- Indicate when any key is pressed.\nKeep logic synchronous and avoid combinational feedback or latches.\n\n\n\n\nLLM Prompt B.3: Integrate and Display\n\nTarget device: Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA with internal oscillator as the root clock source.\nWrite a top-level SystemVerilog module that instantiates the scanner and one-shot modules, shifts the last two keys (older ← most recent; most recent ← new), and drives a multiplexed two-digit seven-segment display.\nRequirements:\n- Update digits only when a new key is registered.\n- Ensure equal apparent brightness and no visible flicker.\n- Keep all logic synthesizable and synchronous.\n- Provide any clock-enable logic as needed.\n- Assume a sevenSegment module exists that maps a 4-bit input to seven outputs.\n\n\nThe monolithic prompt initially produced a full design that looked coherent but failed synthesis due to port mismatches and multiple drivers. When I switched to modular prompts, separating the keypad scanner, one-shot register, and display logic, the code became cleaner, more consistent, and successfully synthesized. Modularizing clearly improved correctness, readability, and debuggability.\nPrompt A partially modularized on its own, but only with explicit direction did it produce well-defined module boundaries and proper FSMs. The FSM structures it used: IDLE, PRESSED, and WAIT_RELEASE with always_ff/always_combseparation were idiomatic and synthesizable, which was a pleasant surprise. Most issues came from active-low keypad logic and naming inconsistencies, which the LLM fixed once clarified.\nNext time, I’d use smaller, guided prompts from the start, defining signal polarity and clock behavior early. This approach made the AI a useful co-designer rather than just a code generator and led to more reliable synthesis results."

    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nTo implement the design, ENCODER_A and ENCODER_B were connected to pins PA6 and PA8, both configured as digital inputs with internal pull-downs to ensure clean signal transitions. The external interrupt (EXTI) peripheral was set to trigger on both rising and falling edges, enabling x4 edge detection for speed and direction measurement.\nTo validate system performance, two more GPIO pins were toggled—one in the main loop (polling) (PA4) and one inside the interrupt handler (PA5). This allowed the oscilloscope comparison of their response times. In the later section, I can confirm that interrupts captured every encoder edge while polling missed several transitions, especially at higher speeds.\nOverall, this lab demonstrated how interrupts provide accurate, real-time measurement of high-speed encoder signals. The setup for calculating speed and determining roational direction is shown below.\n\nCalculating Speed\nIn calculating the velocity we can convene to the TS-25GA370 Datasheet and see that at 12V, the pulses per revolution (PPR) at 408 meaning each full turn of the motor shaft produces 408 complete sqaure-waves cycles on Channel A (and Channel B).\nEach pulse two two channels and two edges per channel (rising and falling), so there are four detectable rising and falling edges per pulse: \\[\n\\text{edges per rev} = \\text{PPR} \\times\\ 4 = 408 \\times\\ 4 = 1632\n\\]\nThe interrupt then detects on every edge of both A and B. Therefore, if the code counts all edges for one seconds, the raw counter give you edge per second. To convert into pulses per second (PPS) - divide by 4. Then to convert to revolutions per second (RPS), divide by PRR: \\[\n\\text{rev/s} = \\frac{\\text{edges per second}}{4\\times\\ 408}\n\\]\nI can take the information and calculate the velocity of the motor at 12V rated at 150 RPM, \\[\n\\text{rev/s} = \\frac{\\text{RPM}}{60\\ \\text{sec}} = \\frac{150 \\frac{rev}{min}}{60\\ \\text{sec}} = 2.5\\ \\text{rev/s}\n\\]\nTherefore, the calculated speed of the motor should about 2.5 rev/s at 12V.\n\n\nRotational Direction Logic\nAs previously stated, Channel A and Channel B are 90° out of phase. So as the motor shaft rotates, A and B take turns rising and falling. A table is shown how we determine clockwise and counter-clockwise rotation:\n\n\n\nChannel A\nChannel B\nRotation (CW)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0\nstart\n\n\n1\n0\nA rises first (CW)\n\n\n1\n1\nB rises next (CWW)\n\n\n0\n1\nA falls (CW)\n\n\n0\n0\nB falls - back to start\n\n\n\nIf motor spins clockwise A leads B and if counter-clockwise, B leads A."

    "section": "Polling vs. Interrupts",
    "text": "Polling vs. Interrupts\nIn this section, it is shown that interrupts outperform polling when sampling at high speeds. To begin, polling means the CPU perodically checks if an input has changed. This check rate depends on the main loop speed and its delays. For example, if an encoder pulses between checks, it’ll miss it. Interrupts are event driven because the hardware triggers the MCU instantly when a change occurs. It pauses the CPU (main loop) to service the event. In simple terms interrupts detect every edge even at high frequency.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Oscilloscope traces of the differences in polling and interrupts and how it captures the encoder signal. Yellow = ENCODER, Blue = INTERRUPT, Pink = POLLING\n\n\nNow this can be connected to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem that says to accurately reconstruct a signal, you sample at twice its maximum frequency to also avoid aliasing and folding: \\[\nf_{s} &gt; 2f_{max}\n\\] For polling, as shown in the figure, the sampling frequency equals how often the loop reads the input. We clearly we that the encoder (yellow) produces a ~2 kHz and the polling pulse (pink) runs at 110 Hz, this is clearly below the Nyquist rate and therefore aliasing the rising/falling edges. The interrupt (blue) triggers at the signal’s edges themselves so Nyquist is never violated and there is no loss of data."

I prompted it to “Write SystemVerilog HDL to leverage the internal high-speed oscillator in the Lattice UP5K FPGA and blink an LED at 2 Hz, using idiomatic SystemVerilog. Copilot produced a short module that instantiated the UP5K high-speed oscillator, divided the clock with a counter, and drove an LED. The style was pretty clean for the counter. However, when I pasted it into a fresh Lattice Radiant project and hit Synthesize, Radiant failed immediately with a syntax error: Copilot had dropped a closing parenthesis in the oscillator instantiation and missed a semicolon at the end of a localparam line. After I copied Radiant’s error text back into Copilot, it regenerated the block with the missing ) and ; added. With those fixed, the synthesis was completed.\nI would rate Copilot’s output as “good scaffolding, needs verification.” It nailed the overall structure and used modern SystemVerilog constructs I like adopting. It also wrote a clear reset path for the counter. None of those were brand-new to me, but it was helpful to see them composed neatly in a minimal example. If I did this again, I would tighten my workflow in three ways:\n\nTreat the LLM as a code generator, not an authority. I’ll immediately run the output, then feed exact tool errors back to the model for focused corrections.\nAsk the LLM to “emit compile ready, tool-specific primitives” and include a checklist in the prompt. That nudge seems to reduce trivial mistakes.\nAdd a quick unit sanity check in the prompt: “Assume ~48 MHz HFOSC; show the counter width/math to reach ~2 Hz.” That forces the model to spell out the divide math, which is convenient to verify before synthesis."

A dedicated temperature sensor library was built on top of the SPI driver providing functions to set resolution (8–12 bits) and read temperature data through two’s-complement conversion.\nThe DS1722 was wired in standard 4-wire SPI mode, with SPI_CE, SPI_SCK, SPI_MISO, and SPI_MOSI connections verified on a logic analyzer. The analyzer confirmed correct clock polarity, phase, and timing between transmitted and received bytes.

The initial response included a clean and modular design with a separate decoder module and a top-level multiplexing module. The use of always_comb and always_ff blocks was appropriate and aligned with best practices for synthesizable code. The logic for toggling between inputs using a simple clock divider was intuitive and easy to follow. I’d rate the output high, mainly because it was correct, sound, and modular, and this is ideal for synthesis and simulation.\nOne interesting aspect was the use of logic instead of reg or wire, which is more idiomatic in SystemVerilog but less common in older Verilog codebases. The always_comb block was also a nice touch because it ensures combinational behavior without the risk of unintended latches. Additionally, the use of a separate decoder module made the design more reusable and testable, which is something I hadn’t considered in my initial approach. The design was synthesized successfully and behaved correctly in simulation.\nIf I were able to redo Lab 2 and implement an LLM in my HDL workflow, I would: - Start with a simulation-first mindset: Even if the code looks correct, simulating it early helps catch subtle issues like latch inference or multiple drivers. - Use the LLM for testbench generation: It’s great at generating stimulus and expected output logic, which speeds up verification."

The maximum delay is when \\(ARR_{max} = 65535\\) : \\[t_{\\max} = (ARR_{\\max} + 1) \\times f_{\\text{tick}}\n= 65536 \\times 1\\ \\text{MHz} \\approx 0.0655\\ \\mu\\text{s} = 65.5 \\, \\text{ms}.\n\\]\nIf longer note durations are required, we can extend them by looping multiple timer intervals.\n\n\nOscilliscope Traces of Frequencies\n\nFigure 2: Oscilloscope capture of a note coded at 262 Hz, measured at 260 Hz. The small difference (≈ 0.76% error) is well within the ±1% accuracy requirement.\n\nFigure 3: Oscilloscope capture of a note coded at 440 Hz, measured at 438 Hz. The frequency deviation (≈ 0.45% error) also satisfies the requirement of less than 1% error.\n\nFigure 4: Oscilloscope capture of a note coded at 659 Hz, measured at 653 Hz. The difference (≈ 0.91% error) remains within the ±1% specification.\n\n\nVerifying of Pitch Accuracy\nTo calculate and validate pitch accuracy across our range (220 – 1000 Hz) we can first evaulate our ARR value with the desired frequency and then move backwards and plug in a rounded down value of ARR due to the hardware imperfections: \\[ARR = \\frac{f_{\\text{tick}}}{f_{out}} - 1\n\\]\nSo therefore, starting with the lower end of the frequency range at 220 Hz, \\[\nARR = \\frac{1\\ \\text{MHz}}{220\\ \\text{Hz}} - 1 =4544.\\overline{45}\n\\]\nNow we can utilize this ARR value and say due to imperfections in hardware and/or software we can round down our ARR value to the nearest integer and then plug it in and see what our actual frequency is, \\[\n{f_\\text{des}} = \\frac{f_\\text{tick}}{ARR + 1} = \\frac{1 \\text{MHz}}{4545} = 220.022\\ \\text{Hz}\n\\]\nNow utilize both the expected and desired frequencies to calculate the percent error, \\[\n\\frac{220.022\\ \\text{Hz} - 220\\ \\text{Hz}}{220\\ \\text{Hz}} = 0.0001 = 0.01\\%\n\\]\nNow we can calculate with our higher end frequency of 1000 Hz using the same method: \\[\nARR = \\frac{1\\ \\text{MHz}}{1000\\ \\text{Hz}} - 1 = 999\n\\]\nBecuase our ARR value is an integer value, theoretically there should be no percent error due based on previous remarks of rounding down decimal values. So our percent error would be zero \\[\n{f_\\text{des}} = {f_\\text{exp}}\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad = 0\\%\n\\]\nWith these calculations, I demonstrated the timer supports all required note frequencies and durations. The pitch accuracy is at least within \\(1\\%\\) across the target range. Rests (when frequency = 0) are correctly implemented by disabling the channel output."

The design successfully played Für Elise at the correct tempo and pitch accuracy, with proper rests. For extension, the design also played the Star Wars theme, and a potentiometer was added for volume control. Frequency accuracy were in range of 1%. I spent approximately 17 hours completing this lab, including datasheet reading, code debugging, and oscilloscope testing.\nWatch the demo!"

    "text": "AI Prototype Summary\nWhen I used ChatGPT to help me code for the STM32L432, I found the output surprisingly effective. The explanations were written in a way that pulled together both the math (timer frequency formulas) and the hardware setup steps (registers, GPIO alternate functions). In some cases, this was faster and clearer than digging through the reference manual on my own, since the manual is dense and not always organized around the specific use case I had in mind. For instance, the LLM explained the relation between PSC, ARR, and the timer input clock in one concise formula, something I would have had to piece together across multiple sections of the manual. This is once I uploaded the manual as reference.\nFor timers, it provided a full recipe with both math and register workflow. So I’d rate it more useful as a teacher than as a pure document search engine."
