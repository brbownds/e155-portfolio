    "text": "Design and Testing Methodology\nThe on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library was used to generate a clock signal at 24 MHz. Then, a counter was used to divide the high-frequency clock signal down so that the blinking frequency could be easily visualized using one of the on-board LEDs.\nThe design was developed using a simple clock divider module which drives the external LED."

The top-level module top includes two submodules: the high-speed oscillator block (HSOSC) and the clock divider module (clk_divider).\n\n\nSchematic\nFigure 2: Schematic of the physical circuit.\nFigure 2 shows the physical layout of the design. An internal 100 kΩ pull-up resistor was used to ensure the active-low reset pin was not floating. The output LED was connected using a 1 kΩ current-limiting resistor to ensure the output current (~2.6 mA) did not exceed the maximum output current of the FPGA I/O pins."

If a more precise output frequency was desired, a more sophisticated counter could be developed. The current design only allows for the clock to be divided by powers of two."
