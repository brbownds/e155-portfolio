Hello! My name is Broderick Bownds and I am a junior engineering major with a focus of Electrical 
and Computer Engineering at Harvey Mudd College. I am passionate abotu designing efficient 
systems at the intersection of hardware and signal processing. My experience spans FPGA development, 
system-level design, CAD-based prototyping. 

Beyond the lab, I am committed to inclusive innovation, such as redesigning neuroimaging caps for textured
hair, mentoring youth in 3D design and coding through Project Think, being involved in NSBE, and leading
through the Annenberg Leadership Forum.
