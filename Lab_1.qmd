title: "FPGA Lab Report: High-Speed Oscillator LED Blinker"
---

## Introduction
In this lab, a design was implemented on the FPGA to demonstrate the functionality of the on-board high-speed oscillator by blinking one of the on-board LEDs. The high-speed oscillator was configured at a frequency of 48 MHz and divided down using a counter to achieve a blinking frequency of 2.4 Hz.

## Design and Testing Methodology
The on-board high-speed oscillator (HSOSC) from the iCE40 UltraPlus primitive library was used to generate a clock signal at 24 MHz. Then, a counter was used to divide the high-frequency clock signal down so that the blinking frequency could be easily visualized using one of the on-board LEDs.

The design was developed using a simple clock divider module which drives the external LED.

## Technical Documentation
The source code for the project can be found in the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/brbownds/e155-lab1).

### **Block Diagram**

**Figure 1: Block diagram of the Verilog design.**

The block diagram in Figure 1 demonstrates the overall architecture of the design. The top-level module `top` includes two submodules: the high-speed oscillator block (`HSOSC`) and the clock divider module (`clk_divider`).

### Schematic

Figure 2: Schematic of the physical circuit.

Figure 2 shows the physical layout of the design. An internal 100 kΩ pull-up resistor was used to ensure the active-low reset pin was not floating. The output LED was connected using a 1 kΩ current-limiting resistor to ensure the output current (~2.6 mA) did not exceed the maximum output current of the FPGA I/O pins.

## Results and Discussion
The design met all intended design objectives.

### Testbench Simulation

Note that the timescale for the clock divider was modified to divide by 4. If a more precise output frequency was desired, a more sophisticated counter could be developed. The current design only allows for the clock to be divided by powers of two.

## Conclusion
The design successfully blinked an external LED using the on-board high-speed oscillator. I spent a total of **two hours** working on this lab.
